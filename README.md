Homework 2 portfolio

## Description: Responsive Portfolio

* The project contains a navigation bar (navbar), responsive layout, and responsive images. This project utilizes both CSS and Bootstrap to style the pages. The navbar is set to fluid so that it will take up the entire width of the page. Overall, this project utilizes the grid layout to be responsive to the change in screen sizes, particularly at 980px, 768px, and 640px. The footer of the page is sticky, so that it stays below the main content of the page and will be pushed down if there is more content for the user to scroll through.

* At 768px, the page navbar changes from the links being listed to a toggler as it is being responsive to the change in screen size. 

* At 640px, a small screen, the main content, not including the navbar and footer,  takes up the width of the entire screen with space on either side, the margin. Additionally, the images in the portfolio will shift to accommodate the change in screen size.
